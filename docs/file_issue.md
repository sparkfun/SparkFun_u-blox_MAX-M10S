## Problems in the Hardware Design

All of our designs are open-source! Please help us make it better.

* Our board design files are contained in the [`Hardware` folder](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_MAX-M10S/tree/main/Hardware) of the [SparkFun u-blox MAX-M10S](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_MAX-M10S) repository. 

### Does something not make sense?
If part of the design is confusing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_USB-C_Host_Shield/issues) and let us know.

### Did we forget to include an important function of the board?
* Please keep in mind that we may intentionally exclude certain functions of the board to meet our product design requirements. *(For example, our Qwiic Micro boards are intended to fit on a small board layout and only use I<sup>2</sup>C communication; therefore, we may not have the SPI and interrupt pins available for users.)*
* If part of the board's functionality is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_u-blox_MAX-M10S/issues) and file a feature request.

### Do you wish to contribute directly to improving the board design?
1. With a GitHub account, Fork this repo
2. Add your design improvement(s)
3. File a pull request with your changes, and enjoy making the ~~words~~ ~~worlds~~ world a better place.
    * Once received, the engineer in charge of the original design will automatically be notified.
    * We will review your suggested improvement(s), if they are within our board design standards and meet our product design requirements, we will flag these changes for our next board revision. *(Please note, that even if your suggestion is accepted, these changes may not be immediate. We may have to cycle through our current product inventory first.)*
